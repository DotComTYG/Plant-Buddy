## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Distribution

To create a distributable version of the app:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Packaging for Windows (Important!)
- **On macOS:** Building a Windows `.exe` requires Wine. On Apple Silicon, this is complex and may not work due to missing `wine64`. The recommended way is to build on a real Windows machine or use a cloud CI (like GitHub Actions).
- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  npx electron-packager . "Plant Buddy" --platform=win32 --arch=ia32 --icon=assets/electron.ico --overwrite
  ```
- **On macOS:**
  ```bash
  npx electron-packager . "Plant Buddy" --platform=darwin --arch=x64 --icon=assets/electron.icns --overwrite
  ```

---

## üßπ Cleaning Up Before Publishing
- Delete all `.DS_Store` files (macOS metadata)
- Remove `tmp-svg2png/` and `assets/PlantBuddy.iconset/` if not needed
- Only keep necessary assets (icons, images used in the app)
